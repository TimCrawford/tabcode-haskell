## TabCode Parser

The Tabcode language was developed by Tim Crawford for typing lute
tablature sources in a simple ASCII format. This package provides a
parser for the language, a collection of data types for representing
lute tablature, and tools for checking and converting Tabcode files.

It is a work-in-progress and not yet usable.
